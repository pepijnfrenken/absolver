# Filing AIWG Issues

You are helping a user (or yourself, as an autonomous agent) file a high-quality issue. The bar is set by the recent tester-report import sweep (Gitea #1264–#1269): environment captured, exact commands, error text in code blocks, suggested fix paths.

This is an **AIWG-specific kernel capability**. Use it for filing, importing, or triaging the quality of issue reports about AIWG itself.

Do **not** use this skill for general backlog processing:

- Use `issue-audit` / `audit-issues` when the user asks to audit open issues, triage a backlog, find duplicates, review stale issues, or rank work.
- Use `address-issues` when the user asks to fix, process, or work through issues.
- Treat `aiwg-*` skill names as AIWG product/workspace capabilities, not as the generic issue-processing surface.

## When this fires

Natural-language triggers:

- "file an AIWG issue"
- "report an AIWG bug"
- "import this AIWG issue from GitHub"
- "I want to file an issue"
- "How do I report a bug?"
- "Help me write up a bug report"
- "What template should I use?"
- "Should I file a new issue or comment on an existing one?"
- "Import this report from GitHub" / "from Discord" / "from email"

Non-triggers:

- "audit open issues"
- "triage the issue backlog"
- "review stale issues"
- "address issues"
- "process open issues"

## Template selection

| Template | When to use | Path |
|---|---|---|
| `bug-report.md` | One concrete defect with a reproduction | `.gitea/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md` |
| `feature-request.md` | A new capability or enhancement proposal | `.gitea/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.md` |
| `tester-report.md` | A single session that surfaced multiple findings | `.gitea/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/tester-report.md` |
| `imported-report.md` | Mirroring an issue filed in a different tracker | `.gitea/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/imported-report.md` |

Templates exist in both `.gitea/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (for Gitea) and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (for the GitHub mirror). Pick the one matching the target tracker; the content is identical.

## The walkthrough

### 1. Triage first

Ask: is this one bug, or multiple findings from a single session?

- **One issue** → `bug-report.md` or `feature-request.md`
- **Multiple findings** → `tester-report.md`, split into discrete bugs during follow-up triage
- **Already filed elsewhere** → `imported-report.md`

**One bug per issue.** If three things broke, file three issues (or one tester-report and split). Don't bundle.

### 2. Duplicate detection (BEFORE filing)

Always check for duplicates first. Cheaper to comment on an existing thread than file again. Use:

```bash
aiwg discover "<keywords from the proposed title>"
```

Then search the tracker for matching titles. The `steward-prep-delivery` skill bundles both lookups into one command:

```bash
aiwg run skill steward-prep-delivery -- "<search terms>"
```

If a likely duplicate exists, comment on it rather than filing fresh.

### 3. Environment capture (REQUIRED — three non-negotiable fields)

Bug reports without **AIWG version + operating system + provider** are bounced before triage. Collect ALL of these:

```bash
aiwg version           # → AIWG version + channel (REQUIRED)
uname -a               # → operating system + kernel (REQUIRED)
node --version         # → Node version
aiwg doctor            # workspace health snapshot (helpful)
```

And — also required — the **provider** (the AIWG harness in use): one of `claude-code`, `hermes`, `codex`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `warp`, `factory`, `opencode`, `windsurf`, `openclaw`.

When you (the agent) draft a bug report on behalf of a user, **ask explicitly for each of the three required fields** if they aren't already in the conversation. Don't infer. The May-2026 jmagly→roctinam import sweep needed a correction round because the original GitHub report cited "Claude Code 2.1.137" but the actual harness in use was hermes — same bug, different behavior, wasted half a round-trip to clarify. Don't repeat that.

The bug-report template has a checklist that enforces this; surface it before the operator submits.

### 4. Reproducible repro

Paste **exact** commands (copy-paste-ready, no `<placeholder>`s without explicit substitution instructions) and **exact** error text in fenced code blocks. Paraphrased errors lose detail.

Bad:
> "When I run the steward command it errors out"

Good:
> ```
> $ aiwg steward capabilities --provider claude-code
> ERROR ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/node_modules/aiwg/dist/agentic/code/providers/capability-matrix.yaml'
> ```

### 5. Title format

`type(scope): one-line summary`. Examples:

- `bug(steward): AIWG_ROOT path resolution lands at dist/ instead of package root`
- `feat(contributing): consistent PR + Issue templates`
- `regression: Skill Seekers implementation lost`
- `imported: <original title> (<source>#<number>)` for imports

Vague titles ("doesn't work", "broken") get bumped back. Insist on the typed form.

### 6. Suggested fix (if you've investigated)

If you've already traced the bug, point at the file or line. "I think this is in `src/cli/handlers/steward.ts:26`" is faster than a round-trip. This is optional but valued — the recent #1261/#1262/#1263 imports landed faster because the original reporter included file-line pointers.

### 7. Acceptance criteria

Bug reports should include checkable acceptance:

```markdown
- [ ] Repro from "Steps to reproduce" no longer fails
- [ ] Regression test added (if the bug bypassed existing tests)
- [ ] Related docs updated (if behavior was documented incorrectly)
```

Feature requests need concrete, checkable conditions — not "works well" or "feels right".

## Import flow (cross-tracker reports)

When a report lands in a different tracker (GitHub mirror, Discord, email, vendor support), mirror to Gitea as `imported-report.md`:

1. Title: `imported: <original title> (<source>#<number>)`
2. Link the source URL
3. Preserve the **original reporter handle** and **platform/environment** (correct it if the source got it wrong)
4. Add a "Status against current main" table
5. Cross-reference any local issues that duplicate or overlap
6. If already fixed: note the resolving commit and close as duplicate
7. **Thank the original reporter** in a closing comment when the work lands

Example: jmagly#108–#112 → roctinam #1264–#1268 sweep (May 2026).

## Filing

```bash
aiwg run skill issue-create -- "<title>" --provider gitea --labels "bug"
```

Or use the tracker's web UI with the template. Both are valid.

For Gitea via MCP (if available):

```yaml
mcp__git-gitea__issue_write:
  method: create
  owner: roctinam
  repo: aiwg
  title: '<title>'
  body: '<full body following bug-report.md template>'
```

## After filing

- Add labels (priority, area, type) per the `ops-issue-tracking` rule conventions
- Link related issues with `Refs #N` / `Blocked-by: #N` / `Blocks: #N` in the body
- Watch the thread for triage comments and answer promptly

## Anti-patterns to flag

- **"While I'm at it"** — adding unrelated changes to a bug report. Split into separate issues.
- **Bundling fixes into the report** — if you have a fix, file the issue first, then submit the PR with `Closes #N`. Don't mix.
- **Re-filing duplicates** — always run duplicate detection first.
- **Vague titles** — `type(scope): subject` form is required.
- **Missing environment** — bug reports without OS/version/platform get clarified before action.
