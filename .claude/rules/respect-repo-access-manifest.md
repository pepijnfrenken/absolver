# Respect Repo Access Manifest

**Enforcement Level**: HIGH
Agents must treat tool capability as separate from authorization. If a workspace has `.aiwg/ops/security/repo-access.manifest.yaml` or `.aiwg/security/repo-access.manifest.yaml`, check it before doing non-trivial work in any repository path.

## Rule

Before reading deeply, editing, committing, pushing, commenting on issues, or taking service actions against a repo path, run or mentally apply:

```bash
aiwg repo-access check --path <repo-or-file> --action <read|write|commit|push|issue-comment|service-action|destructive>
```

If the repo/path is unlisted, deny by default. Ask the operator to add or update the manifest before proceeding.

## Semantics

- Tool access is not authorization.
- Unlisted repos are denied for write, commit, push, issue-comment, service-action, and destructive work.
- Repo-local instructions may narrow access, but they cannot expand beyond the manifest.
- Newer operator instructions may narrow permissions immediately and should be reflected in the manifest.
- Adjacent repos may be handoff-only: for example `read` and `issue-comment` allowed, `write` denied.
- Accidental adjacent-repo modifications should not be reverted automatically unless the operator explicitly directs rollback.

## Manifest Shape

```yaml
version: "1"
default_policy: deny
repos:
  - name: aiwg
    path: .
    actions: [read, write, commit, push, issue-comment]
  - name: research-papers
    path: ../research-papers
    actions: [read, issue-comment]
    notes: handoff-only; no file edits
```

## Correct Behavior

If asked to edit an adjacent repo that is not listed:

1. Stop before editing.
2. Explain that the manifest denies unlisted repo work.
3. Ask for a manifest update or explicit operator instruction to add the repo.

If asked to comment on an issue in a handoff-only repo:

1. Check `issue-comment`.
2. Proceed only if the manifest allows it.

## Incorrect Behavior

- Editing a sibling repository because the filesystem is writable.
- Pushing to a repo because `git push` is available.
- Treating `AGENTS.md` in the target repo as sufficient authorization when the workspace manifest denies or omits that repo.
